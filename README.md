# TeSa: TrajEctory-based and Semantic-Aware DHGNN

[TOC]

## Introduction

> **Motivation** Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNNs) are powerful for modeling dynamic interactions, but most methods focus on homogeneous graphs, ignoring the complexity of heterogeneous graphs found in many real-world scenarios. Capturing different types of nodes and edges allows for better understanding of complex relationships and evolving semantics.
> **Method** We propose TeSa, a Trajectory and Semantic-aware Dynamic Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network. TeSa combines trajectory-based evolution to model individual node dynamics and semantic-aware aggregation to capture complex relationships between nodes. Using temporal point processes and multi-type edge aggregation, TeSa effectively models dynamic and heterogeneous graph structures. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets.
